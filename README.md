# Food_Calorie_prediction_ML
Our goal is to build a multimodal model to estimate the calories of the lunches consumed from the sensing data, photographs, micro gut health, demographics, and the data from the breakfasts. Dataset contains breakfast and lunch information, data on motion, and photographs of meals, across over 40 participants and up to 10 days.
